What is the potential risk to the $1.6 trillion in auto loans currently on financial institution balance sheets?,"The textual content mentions that interest rate hikes have increased monthly car loan payments by around 27%, from $581 to $739, leading to a record high number of subprime auto loans delinquent by 60+ days. It also references Wright's Law, predicting that electric vehicle (EV) prices should continue to fall, shifting more miles onto electric platforms and decreasing the value of gas-powered vehicles. Consequently, the slide warns that the approximately $1.6 trillion in auto loans currently on financial institution balance sheets, which are predominantly for gas-powered vehicles, could be at risk over the next 10 years.

Please note that this description is based on a visual analysis of the image and the text contained within it. The actual data or specific values are not fully extractable due to the resolution of the image.","The potential risk to the $1.6 trillion in auto loans on financial institution balance sheets is multifaceted. Firstly, the increase in interest rates leading to higher monthly car loan payments could result in a higher default rate, especially among subprime borrowers who are already showing signs of strain with a record number of loans delinquent by 60+ days. This could lead to significant credit losses for lenders. Secondly, as Wright's Law predicts a decrease in EV prices, the shift towards electric platforms may reduce the resale value of gas-powered vehicles, which could exacerbate loan-to-value ratios on existing auto loans. This devaluation risk could lead to further losses for financial institutions if borrowers default and the collateral (the gas-powered vehicle) is worth less than the outstanding loan balance. Over the next decade, these factors could combine to create substantial financial instability for lenders with heavy exposure to auto loans, particularly those concentrated in gas-powered vehicles."
